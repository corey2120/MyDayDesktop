## 🔨 Build System

### Gradle Configuration
- Multi-module setup
- Desktop-specific dependencies
- Fat JAR generation
- Optimized packaging

### Package Creation
```bash
# Build everything
./build-package.sh all

# Individual packages
./build-package.sh appimage
./build-package.sh tarball

# Quick test
./run.sh
```

### What Happens During Build
1. Gradle compiles Kotlin code
2. Creates fat JAR with all dependencies
3. AppImage: Packages JAR with launcher into AppImage format
4. Tarball: Creates distribution folder with JAR, launcher, and docs
5. Both formats are tested and verified
