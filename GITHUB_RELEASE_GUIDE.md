# How to Add MyDay Desktop to GitHub Releases

This guide will help you create a GitHub release and upload your distribution files.

## Distribution Files Ready

You have these files ready to upload:
- `MyDay-1.0.1-x86_64.AppImage` (69 MB)
- `MyDay-1.0.1-linux.tar.gz` (68 MB)

## Method 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

### Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

First, make sure your code is on GitHub:

```bash
cd /home/cobrien/Projects/MyDayDesktop

# Initialize git if not already done
git init

# Add all files (except those in .gitignore)
git add .

# Create your first commit
git commit -m "Release v1.0.1 - Calendar sync, news widget, and more"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
# Replace 'yourusername' with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/MyDayDesktop.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Note:** If you get an error about the branch name, you might need to rename it:
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Method 3: Using Git Tags and Manual Upload

```bash
cd /home/cobrien/Projects/MyDayDesktop

# Create and push a tag
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Release v1.0.1 - Calendar Sync & Enhanced Features"
git push origin v1.0.1

# Then go to GitHub web interface and create release from tag
# Upload files manually as described in Method 1
```

---

## Important Notes

### Before You Push

1. **Check .gitignore:**
   ```bash
   cat .gitignore
   ```
   Make sure it excludes:
   - `*.AppImage`
   - `*.tar.gz`
   - `build/`
   - `.gradle/`
   - `*.log`

2. **Don't commit large binaries to git:**
   - Distribution files (AppImage, tarball) should ONLY be uploaded to releases
   - Never commit them to the repository itself
   - They'll make your repo huge and slow

3. **Update README URLs:**
   - Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username in README.md
   - Update all download links to point to your repository

### File Size Considerations

- GitHub allows up to 2 GB per file in releases
- Your files (68-69 MB each) are well within limits
- Upload may take a few minutes depending on internet speed

### Creating Future Releases

For future versions (v1.0.2, etc.):

1. Build new distributions:
   ```bash
   ./build-package.sh all
   ```

2. Update version numbers in:
   - `build.gradle.kts`
   - `SettingsScreen.kt`
   - `build-package.sh`

3. Create a new release following the same steps above

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "refused to update checkout branch"
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main --force
```

### Issue: "remote: Repository not found"
- Make sure the repository exists on GitHub
- Check that the URL is correct
- Ensure you have push permissions

### Issue: "Upload failed"
- Check your internet connection
- Try uploading files one at a time
- Make sure files aren't corrupted (run `./MyDay-1.0.1-x86_64.AppImage` to test)

### Issue: "Tag already exists"
```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d v1.0.1

# Delete remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.1

# Create new tag
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Release v1.0.1"
git push origin v1.0.1
```
