# MyDay Desktop - Project Summary

## Overview

MyDay Desktop is a comprehensive task management application for Linux that combines Tasks, Calendar, and Notes into a unified experience. Built with Kotlin Compose Multiplatform, it brings the Android MyDay app to the desktop with enhanced features.

## Key Features Implemented

- Navigate between months
- Visual indicators for days with tasks
- "Today" highlighting
- Task details panel for selected dates
- Color-coded task lists

### 3. **Notes (MyJournal-style)**
- **Write-first, name-later workflow** - Start writing immediately without thinking about titles
- Full-screen, distraction-free editor

## Technical Architecture

### Data Persistence
- JSON-based storage in `~/.myday/data.json`
- All data persists between sessions
- Tasks, task lists, notes, and settings all saved

```

## Key Differences from Android Version

1. **Desktop Navigation**: Bottom navigation bar instead of horizontal pager
2. **Window Management**: Desktop window with proper size (1200x800dp)
3. **Data Storage**: File-based persistence instead of Room database
4. **Note Editor**: Full MyJournal-style editor with write-first workflow
5. **No Secure Notes**: Desktop version focuses on simplicity (can be added later)
6. **No Google Calendar Sync**: Local-only for now (can be added later)

## Notes Section - Key Improvements

The notes section is redesigned following the MyJournal pattern:

1. **Immediate Writing**: Click + and start typing immediately
2. **No Title Field**: Focus entirely on content
3. **Save Dialog**: Name the note only when saving
4. **Rich Customization**: Theme colors, text colors, and font sizes
5. **Persistent Preferences**: Each note remembers its own style
6. **Grid Layout**: Beautiful staggered grid for notes overview
7. **Date Formatting**: Smart relative dates (e.g., "2h ago", "3d ago")

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- Export notes to PDF/text
- Search functionality across tasks and notes
- Tags/categories for notes
- Dark mode support
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Task priorities
- Recurring tasks
- Google Calendar sync
- AppImage/Flatpak packaging
- Import/export functionality
- Markdown support in notes
- Attachments for notes

## Files Created

1. `build.gradle.kts` - Gradle build configuration
2. `settings.gradle.kts` - Gradle settings
3. `gradle.properties` - Build properties
4. `src/main/kotlin/com/cobrien/myday/` - All Kotlin source files
5. `README.md` - User documentation
6. `build.sh` - Build script
7. `run.sh` - Quick run script
8. `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules

## Data Format

The app stores all data in `~/.myday/data.json` with this structure:

```json
{
  "tasks": [...],
  "taskLists": [...],
  "notes": [...],
  "settings": {
    "defaultBackgroundColor": 4294956769,
    "defaultTextColor": 4285558839,
    "defaultFontSize": 16
  }
}
```

## Status

✅ **Complete and Functional**
- All three main features (Tasks, Calendar, Notes) implemented
- Data persistence working
- UI responsive and polished
- Build system configured
- Ready to run and use

The application successfully builds and runs. All core functionality is implemented and working.
