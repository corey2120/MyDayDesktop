# MyDay Desktop - What's New

## Overview
MyDay Desktop transforms the Android MyDay application into a native Linux desktop app with significant improvements to the Notes section, inspired by MyJournal Desktop.

## Major Changes from Android Version

### üé® Notes Section - Complete Redesign

The notes section has been completely reimagined following the MyJournal philosophy:

#### Before (Android MyDay):
- Small text field dialog for quick notes
- Title required upfront
- Limited customization
- Basic card view
- No theming options

#### After (Desktop MyDay):
- **Full-screen editor** for distraction-free writing
- **Write-first workflow** - no title field during writing
- **Save dialog** appears when you're done - name it then
- **Rich theming system**:
  - 5 background themes (Cream, Mint, Sky, Rose, Lavender)
  - 5 text colors (Brown, Gray, Blue, Green, Purple)
  - Font size slider (12-24sp)
- **Beautiful grid layout** with staggered cards
- **Persistent styling** - each note remembers its colors
- **Date display** showing when you wrote it
- **Smart date formatting** - "2h ago", "3d ago", or full date

### üìù Writing Experience

**MyJournal-style Features:**
1. Click + to create note
2. Immediately start writing (no title prompt)
3. See today's date at the top
4. Customizable placeholder text encourages free writing
5. When done, click save
6. Dialog appears: "Name Your Note"
7. Give it a title (or leave as "Untitled")
8. Note is saved with all your customizations

**Placeholder Text Example:**
```
Start writing your thoughts...

What's on your mind?
What happened today?
Ideas, plans, or reflections?

Write freely, you'll name this note when you're done.
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Desktop-Specific Improvements

1. **Navigation**: Clean bottom navigation bar (Tasks | Calendar | Notes)
2. **Window Size**: Optimized 1200x800dp window
3. **Keyboard-Friendly**: Desktop interaction patterns
4. **File Storage**: Simple JSON file at `~/.myday/data.json`
5. **No Permissions**: No Android permissions needed

### üéØ Task & Calendar Features (Preserved)

All the task management and calendar features from Android are preserved:
- Multiple task lists with colors
