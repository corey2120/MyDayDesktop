## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Windows packaging** - Complex, platform-specific
   - Mitigation: Start early, test frequently
2. **Drag & drop** - Compose Desktop support may be limited
   - Mitigation: Research early, have fallback plan
3. **Android sync** - Breaking changes could affect mobile
   - Mitigation: Careful data model changes, version properly

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Performance** - May not hit 50% improvement goal
   - Mitigation: Profile early, iterate
2. **Animations** - Could hurt performance
   - Mitigation: Make them optional, optimize

---

## Development Approach

1. **Incremental Development** - Build feature by feature
2. **Continuous Testing** - Test after each feature
3. **User Feedback** - Beta testing for major features
4. **Documentation** - Document as you build
5. **Android Coordination** - Keep mobile app in sync
